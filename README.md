# Code Trialz 👨🏻‍⚖️ 

CodeTrialz is a full-stack **online judge platform** that enables users to register, solve coding challenges in multiple languages (C++, Python, JavaScript, Java), submit code for evaluation, and view detailed feedback. It also features admin verification, AI-powered suggestions for accepted solutions, and a microservices-based deployment architecture.

## 📦 Features

### User Authentication
Users can register using a valid email ID, which also allows them to securely reset their password if needed.

### Session Management
Upon signing in, users are assigned secure cookies to maintain their session.

### Challenge Creation
Authenticated users can create new coding problems and attach multiple custom test cases to each.

### Admin Verification
All submitted problems and test cases undergo an admin review process before being made publicly available.

### Code Submission Interface
Users can browse verified problems and solve them using an integrated code editor that supports four languages — C++, Python, JavaScript, and Java.

### Secure Execution
Code is executed inside isolated containers and automatically evaluated against the provided test cases.

### AI Suggestions
If a solution is accepted, users receive real-time AI-powered suggestions to enhance their code quality.

### User Profiles
Each user has a profile page where they can view their submission history and other details.

- Separate [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container on a different [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance

### 🐳 Containerization & Deployment
- The project follows a microservices architecture, split into two backend services:
  - `General API Service`: Handles authentication, problem CRUD, submission history, and AI integration.
  - `Code Execution Service`: Securely executes submitted code in isolated environments for C++, Python, JavaScript, and Java.
- 🧊 Backend Deployment:
    - Both microservices are containerized using Docker.
    - Each service is deployed on a separate AWS EC2 instance for isolation and scalability.
    - Docker containers are configured to restart automatically on failure for reliability.
- 🌐 Frontend Deployment:
    - Frontend is built with React + Vite and deployed on Vercel for seamless CI/CD and global edge delivery.
- 🌍 Custom Domain & SSL:
    - A custom domain was purchased via Hostinger.
    - The domain was mapped to both the frontend (Vercel) and backend (AWS EC2 instances) using DNS A and CNAME records.
    - HTTPS/SSL was enabled for the backend APIs using Certbot and Let’s Encrypt:
    - Backend Express servers were configured to serve via HTTPS using the generated SSL certificates.
